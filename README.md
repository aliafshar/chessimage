Chess Board Image Generator
--

Generates JPEGs of chess board positions, using FEN. Enter the FEN as the path
and you will get an image back. For example, if you pass a URL like:

http://chessembed.appspot.com/r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R

You will get an image like:

![RuyLopez](http://chessembed.appspot.com/r1bqkbnr/pppp1ppp/2n5/1B2p3/4P3/5N2/PPPP1PPP/RNBQK2R)

There are no options or anything, but should be easy to add.
